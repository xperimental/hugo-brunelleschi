# hugo-brunelleschi

This is a theme for [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/), a static site generator. The theme is based on the WordPress theme with the same name by Kit MacAllister.

I ported this theme from WordPress because it was the theme currently in use by my website. It does not have all the features the original theme had, I just ported the features I needed to get the site to look like the old version.

## Usage

Check out this theme into the `themes/` directory of your site and use it with `hugo -t hugo-brunelleschi` or specify it as default in your configuration file.

## Links

The site linked to by the original theme seems to have gone offline. The new page of Kit MacAllister seems to be [kittrick.co](http://kittrick.co/).
